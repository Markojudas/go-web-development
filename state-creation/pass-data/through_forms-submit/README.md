# Passing Values from Forms

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

When a form is submitted, we can pass the submitted values either through the request body payload or through the URL. If the form's method attribute is POST, then the values of the form are sent to the server through the request body's payload. If the form's method attribute is GET, then the values of the form are sent to the server through the URL.
