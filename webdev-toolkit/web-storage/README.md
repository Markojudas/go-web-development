# Web-Storage

Web-Storage is a catch-all phrase for local storage and session storage. We can use `cookie storage`, `local storage`, and `session storage`.

**NOTE:** there is no go code here just HTML examples. There is a some **JavaScript** needed to access web-storage.

**Differences:**
Session Storage lasts until the browser is restarted whereas local storage lasts until **explicitly** deleted
